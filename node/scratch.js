// how to print to the console, the second most important thing to learn in any language.
console.log("Im a real boy")

// example of hosting in action 
console.log(thing = "something") // undefined
// Variables
// Declared, usin very specific words.

// let - a mutable variable, the value can be change.This may be reassigned

// = is the assignment operator,this does not represent equality
let myName = "Tony"  // String begins with ",',` and contains characters


// const - is an immutable variable, meaning it cannot be reassigned
const theSky = "is blue"

//var - is mutable, and is cointatined in the global scope.
// It recives the super power of hoisting,
var thing = "hoisted"


// Primitive values, are the most generic values. Types of data in their simplest form.
console.log(typeof myName, "<<<< this is me checking the variable myName..") 
console.log("This is a>>",typeof 1)
console.log("This is a>>", typeof 12.3)
console.log("This is a>>",typeof true)
console.log("This is a>>", typeof false)
console.log("This is a>>", typeof null) // This is the developer setting this value explicitly 
console.log("This is a>>", typeof undefined) // This is random

// Everything in javascript is true, except
// [], "", 0, null, undefined, false, NaN - not a number

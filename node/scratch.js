// let - a mutable variable, the value can be change.This may be reassigned

// = is the assignment operator,this does not represent equality
let myName = "Tony"  // String begins with ",',` and contains characters

const theSky = "is blue"

//var - is mutable, and is cointatined in the global scope.
// It recives the super power of hoisting,
var thing = "hoisted"
